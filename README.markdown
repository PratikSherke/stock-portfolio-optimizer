The **Stock Price Prediction Dashboard** is a powerful web application built with Streamlit that enables users to predict stock prices for the next 1‚Äì30 days using advanced machine learning models. It combines deep learning (GRU and LSTM) with traditional machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM) to provide accurate forecasts for a curated list of top-performing stocks.

## üöÄ Features

- **Future Price Predictions**: Forecasts stock prices for the next 1‚Äì30 days based on user-selected prediction horizons.
- **Multi-Model Predictions**: Utilizes GRU, LSTM, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM for robust stock price forecasting.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly Streamlit interface with customizable parameters for stock selection, lookback days (30‚Äì120), and prediction days.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches live stock data via the `yfinance` library for up-to-date market insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Plotly-powered charts displaying historical prices and future predictions with a modern design.
- **Company Insights**: Displays company details, including market capitalization, current price, price change, and business summaries.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates models using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤, presented in styled tables.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes models with GridSearchCV for SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, and manual tuning for LSTM.
- **Responsive Design**: Custom CSS ensures a visually appealing, responsive UI for desktop and mobile.

## üìä Usage

1. **Select Stocks**: Choose from 50 top companies (e.g., MSFT, AAPL, NVDA) in the sidebar.
2. **Set Parameters**: Adjust lookback days (30‚Äì120) and prediction days (1‚Äì30) using sliders.
3. **Run Analysis**: Click "Run Analysis" to fetch data, train models, and generate predictions.
4. **View Results**: Explore company info, recent prices, prediction charts, model metrics, predicted prices, and hyperparameters.

## üß† Models and Algorithms

- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: Lightweight RNN for capturing temporal patterns.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Robust RNN with tuned units, activations, and learning rates.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Optimized via GridSearchCV for regression.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method with tuned hyperparameters.
- **XGBoost**: High-performance gradient boosting algorithm.
- **LightGBM**: Efficient gradient boosting for large datasets.

Models are trained on historical data, predicting prices for the next 1‚Äì30 days. Performance is evaluated with MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤.

## üìà Visualizations

Interactive Plotly charts show:
- Historical prices for the last 30 days.
- Predicted prices for the user-specified forecast period.
- A connecting line between actual and predicted prices.

Charts are styled with custom CSS and Plotly's white template.

## üìù Data Sources

- **Stock Data**: Sourced from Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`.
- **Company Information**: Includes market cap, current price, and business summaries from Yahoo Finance.

## üîß Customization

- Modify the `stock_options` list to include different stocks.
- Adjust hyperparameters (`RNN_UNITS`, `ACTIVATIONS`, `LEARNING_RATES`) for deep learning models.
- Tune `TEST_SPLIT`, `BATCH_SIZE`, and `EPOCHS` for training.
- Customize CSS in the `st.markdown` section for UI enhancements.

## üìö Future Enhancements

- Add models like Prophet or ARIMA.
- Implement real-time price streaming.
- Incorporate sentiment analysis from financial news or X posts.
- Enable export of predictions and metrics as CSV or PDF.
- Optimize training with GPU acceleration.
