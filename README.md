üìà Stock Price Prediction Dashboard











The Stock Price Prediction Dashboard is a powerful web application built with Streamlit that enables users to predict stock prices for the next 1‚Äì30 days using advanced machine learning models. It combines deep learning (GRU and LSTM) with traditional machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM) to provide accurate forecasts for a curated list of top-performing stocks.

üöÄ Features





Future Price Predictions: Forecasts stock prices for the next 1‚Äì30 days based on user-selected prediction horizons.



Multi-Model Predictions: Utilizes GRU, LSTM, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM for robust stock price forecasting.



Interactive Dashboard: User-friendly Streamlit interface with customizable parameters for stock selection, lookback days (30‚Äì120), and prediction days.



Real-Time Data: Fetches live stock data via the yfinance library for up-to-date market insights.



Interactive Visualizations: Plotly-powered charts displaying historical prices and future predictions with a modern design.



Company Insights: Displays company details, including market capitalization, current price, price change, and business summaries.



Performance Metrics: Evaluates models using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤, presented in styled tables.



Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes models with GridSearchCV for SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, and manual tuning for LSTM.



Responsive Design: Custom CSS ensures a visually appealing, responsive UI for desktop and mobile.

üß† Models and Algorithms





GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): Lightweight RNN for capturing temporal patterns.



LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Robust RNN with tuned units, activations, and learning rates.



SVM (Support Vector Machine): Optimized via GridSearchCV for regression.



Random Forest: Ensemble method with tuned hyperparameters.



XGBoost: High-performance gradient boosting algorithm.



LightGBM: Efficient gradient boosting for large datasets.

Models are trained on historical data, predicting prices for the next 1‚Äì30 days. Performance is evaluated with MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤.

üìà Visualizations

Interactive Plotly charts show:





Historical prices for the last 30 days.



Predicted prices for the user-specified forecast period.



A connecting line between actual and predicted prices.

Charts are styled with custom CSS and Plotly's white template.
